ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement:
 Educational institutions face challenges in managing student admissions, tracking
 performance, maintaining attendance, and ensuring effective communication between
 teachers, students, and parents. Many schools and colleges rely on manual processes or
 separate systems, leading to fragmented data, inefficiencies, and communication delays.
 Without a centralized CRM, educational management struggles with poor visibility into
 student progress, delayed decision-making, and inconsistent engagement. To address
 these challenges, a Salesforce-based solution, LearnSmart CRM, is proposed to
 streamline academic processes, automate communication, and enhance student
 experience.
